MIRTK CMake BASIS Templates
===========================

This directory contains template files for the creation of a new MIRTK module.
It can be used with the CMake BASIS "basisproject" tool which automatically
customizes the template files, for example, by inserting the author information
and module description or adding a list of module dependencies. All this can
also be done manually. The _conf.py file is only needed by the "basisproject"
tool and should not be copied into the MIRTK module directory.
