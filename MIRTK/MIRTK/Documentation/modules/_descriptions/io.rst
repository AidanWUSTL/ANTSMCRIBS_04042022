The I/O module of the Medical Image Registration ToolKit (MIRTK) enables the
reading and writing of image and point set files. Supported file formats are
GIPL, PGM, and the `NIfTI file format <http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov>`__.
Image slices can further be written to PNG image files when the MIRTK was built WITH_PNG.
