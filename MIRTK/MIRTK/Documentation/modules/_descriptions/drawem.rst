The Developing brain Region Annotation With Expectation-Maximization (Draw-EM)
module of the Medical Image Registration ToolKit (MIRTK) provides command-line
tools for the automatic segmentation of neonatal brain MR images into the major
tissue classes and a detailed structural segmentation. It is developed by
`Antonios Makropoulos <http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~am411>`__. Please cite his
TMI paper when you use the Draw-EM segmentations in your research studies.
