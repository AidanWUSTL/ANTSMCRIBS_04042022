.. Auto-generated by help-rst from "mirtk evaluate-similarity -h" output


Evaluates the (dis-)similarity of two intensity images.

If more than one source image is given, the (dis-)similarity between
each of these and the target is evaluated. By default, common image
(dis-)similarity metrics are reported. One or more metrics for the
evaluation can be chosen using :option:`evaluate-similarity -metric`.

The input source image can either be pre-aligned with the target image
or the output of a previous registration can be specified using
:option:`evaluate-similarity -dofin`.
