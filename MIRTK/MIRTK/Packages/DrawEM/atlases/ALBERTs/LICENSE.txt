This folder contains the atlases required for the Draw-EM software:

   â€¢ 20 single-subject neonatal atlases that divide the brain into different structures and tissue types.
   These are modified versions of the manually segmented ALBERTs [1],[2] with tissues automatically segmented by [3].
   The ALBERTs are covered by the following license terms.
   Please read carefully the license terms before using the atlases.
