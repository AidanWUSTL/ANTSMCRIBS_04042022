/**
 * Surface inflation force
 *
 * The inflation is driven by the average convexity or concavity of a region.
 * That is, points which lie in concave regions move outwards over time,
 * while points in convex regions move inwards.
 *
 *   Fischl et al., Cortical Surface-Based Analysis II: Inflation, Flattening,
 *   and a Surface-Based Coordinate System. NeuroImage, 9(2), 195â€“207 (1999).
 *
 * This force term is similar to the CurvatureConstraint. Both reduce the
 * curvature of the surface mesh by moving points towards the centroid of the
 * adjacent nodes. The inflation force is defined as the sum of the average
 * squared adjacent edge lengths, while the curvature constraint is defined as
 * the squared distance to the explicitly computed centroid position.
 *
 * Moreover, the average normal component is subtracted from the node force.
 * This modification is not presented in the NeuroImage paper by Fischl et al,
 * but can be seen in the implementation of FreeSurfer's mris_inflate tool
 * (cf. mrisComputeNormalizedSpringTerm in mrisurf.c).
